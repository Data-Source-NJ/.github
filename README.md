# Data SourceNJ

<b>About</b>: DataSourceNJ Inc. is a 501c3 nonprofit seeking to strengthen our democratic processes by invigorating investigative journalism at the local level. DataSourceNJ is working to integrate publicly available data, software technologies, data science, and issues expertise to produce important insights into local government performance and community conditions for journalists and other valuable constituencies (e.g., academicians, government staff, businesspeople, activists, and the general public) to use.  

Those of us at DataSourceNJ are mindful of the warnings of U.S. thought leaders that the current decimation of local journalism is threatening our democracy. Leading U.S. universities and research institutions have linked the decline of local investigative journalism to poor government performance, citizen disengagement, and more polarized and unhealthy communities.
